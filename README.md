## Hi there 👋

Hello and welcome! 👋 I’m a junior Python developer working on improving code quality through unit testing and code coverage. This repository is a collection of my learning and practice projects as I build stronger foundations in writing reliable, maintainable, and testable Python code.

Testing has quickly become one of the most valuable skills I’m developing—not just for catching bugs, but for understanding how to write clean, predictable code. I’m currently focused on unit testing, which involves isolating individual pieces of logic and verifying that they behave as expected. In the process, I’m learning how to think through edge cases, handle errors gracefully, and write better functions from the start.

This repository contains several small Python scripts and modules, each paired with unit tests using frameworks like unittest and pytest. I’m also exploring tools like coverage.py to measure how much of the codebase is covered by tests, and how to improve that coverage without over-testing or writing unnecessary cases.

Beyond just writing tests, I’m learning how to structure projects for testing, mock dependencies when needed, and include tests as a natural part of the development workflow. It’s all about writing code that works—and proving it.

If you’re also learning Python testing, or looking for examples to get started with unit tests and coverage reporting, feel free to check out the code, leave feedback, or collaborate.

Thanks for stopping by! I’m excited to keep growing as a developer and building a strong habit of testing from the start. 🐍🧪✅
